#### You can always count on me...

To help you the best way I can even if I don't know how or the answer. I always try to put a smile on your face ! Because you're so much awsome when you're happy :D

##### A funny Story

When I was a kid, I almost lost my right eye. I was playing in the wood with my childhood friends. Everything was fine but suddenly, I slipped and fell from a rock. When I hit the ground, a stone hurt me near my eye.
Hopefully, It wasn't too severe and like the doctor said "You were lucky! Two centimeters lower and you lost your eye!"
Yes, this sentence traumatized me.

###### TL;DR
How I almost lost my right eye.
